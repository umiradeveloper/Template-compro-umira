The Management Trainee (MT) Program officially started on 13th September 2025, marked by an opening session attended by the company’s management team and selected participants. Out of 700 candidates, only 13 were chosen to embark on this journey — a testament to the program’s competitive and selective process. This program is the first step in shaping the next generation of leaders at PT Umira Sinergi Global.

### Participant's Enthusiasm

The chosen 13 trainees have begun their development journey with a series of activities, including corporate culture onboarding, and introductory managerial workshops.

They will also undergo cross-department and project rotations to gain hands-on experience in the company’s operations.

### Company's Commitment

The management team reaffirmed its commitment to provide full support. Each participant will receive mentorship from senior leaders as well as regular evaluations to ensure progress throughout the program.
