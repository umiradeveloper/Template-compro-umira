We are proud to share the latest progress update from our ongoing construction project at SandatMas Hotel. The team was finished the concrete pouring phase, a critical milestone that forms the structural backbone of the building. This stage involves pouring concrete for the floor slab, which requires precision, coordination, and expert timing to ensure durability and long-term strength.

Concrete pouring phase involves the arrival of a ready-mix concrete truck, which delivers high-quality concrete directly to the site. Under the supervision of experienced personnel, the concrete is poured and spread evenly across the formwork. Our crew on the ground, equipped with full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), uses tools to distribute, compact, and smooth the surface to prevent air gaps and ensure a solid finish.

What You See in the Photo:

- A ready-mix concrete truck discharging concrete through a chute.

- Skilled workers in safety vests and helmets managing the pouring process.

- Concrete being spread evenly and leveled using rakes and trowels.

- Reinforcement bars and embedded piping visible as part of the structure's foundation system.

- The slab pouring stage is one of the most essential parts of the structural build. A well-executed concrete pour provides a strong and stable base for upper construction, ensures the load-bearing capacity of the structure, prevents future cracks or settlement when done correctly, and enhances overall structural integrity and safety.

PT. Umira Sinergi Global maintains the highest standards for Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance. All team members are trained in safe concrete handling and follow industry best practices during every phase. From mixing to placement and finishing, every step is performed under close supervision to ensure the best outcomes. 

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue building with precision!
