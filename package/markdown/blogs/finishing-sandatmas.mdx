From early groundwork to detailed finishing, every step has been executed with precision and commitment to quality. The project’s progress demonstrates not only technical excellence but also the strong collaboration between engineers, architects, field supervisors, and workers in achieving Umira’s standards of professionalism.

#### Highlight of Phase 1 Progress
