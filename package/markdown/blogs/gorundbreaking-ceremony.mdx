We’re excited to announce that construction on Sandatmas Hotel has officially begun! On 19th March 2025, we held a special groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of this meaningful project. Located in Pecatu, this development is designed to bring benefits improved infrastructure and modern living to the area.

#### A Special Moment

As the ceremony began, light rain started to fall — a gentle reminder from nature of new beginnings. Despite the drizzle, spirits were high. With umbrellas in hand and smiles all around, the team gathered to mark this special milestone with optimism and pride.

The atmosphere was intimate and full of energy, as the first stone was placed — a symbolic gesture of everything we’re about to build, together.

#### Our Commitment

We’re more than just builders — we’re partners in shaping the future.

With this project, we’re committed to:

- **High-quality workmanship**
- **Reliable materials**
- **Clear timelines**
- **Honest communication**

We can’t wait to bring this vision to life, step by step.

#### What’s Next

This is just the beginning. We’ll be sharing regular updates as the project moves forward — stay connected with us through this bulletin and on our social media.
